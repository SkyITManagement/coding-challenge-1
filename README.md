# GBCS Frontend Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the coding challenge for new software engineer interns at GBCS Group! This challenge is designed to test your ability to work with React hooks within a Next.js application. You will be creating a to-do list component that demonstrates your understanding of state management and side effects in React.

## Coding Challenge

### Objective

Create a React component that functions as a to-do list using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in a Next.js application.

### Requirements

1. **Component:** The component should allow users to add and mark tasks as completed.
2. **useState Hook:** Use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the to-do list and individual tasks.
3. **useEffect Hook:** Use the `useEffect` hook to log a message to the console whenever the list of tasks changes.

### Steps to Complete the Challenge

1. **Clone the provided repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkyITManagement/coding-challenge-1.git
   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Navigate to the home page:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Implement the component:**
   Open `src/app/todo-list/page.tsx` and complete the implementation of the to-do list component as described in the requirements.

### Features to Implement

- **Task Addition:** Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **State Management:** Use `useState` to manage the tasks and the new task input.
- **Side Effects:** Use `useEffect` to log messages to the console whenever the tasks list changes.

### File to Modify

- `src/app/todo-list/page.tsx`
